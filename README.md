# android_widgets_example

Simple example of the implementation
[Android Home screen widget](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets/overview)
in a Flutter application.

You should create widget itself in native way, you can't do it in Flutter (for now).

[App Widgets Documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets).

Since Android O (v8.0, API 26) we can request to add widget from application.
